      <description>I remember once offering to an editor an article which began with a reference to the experience of last century. &amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;leave out the history and come to the present.&amp;rdquo; I felt like going to him over a thousand miles and taking him by the lapels and saying, &amp;ldquo;Dear, dear jackass! Don&amp;rsquo;t you understand that the past is the present; that without what was, nothing is? That, of the infinite dead, the living are but unimportant bits?</description>

The lady who only read books that improved her mind was taking a safe course - and a hopeless one.</description>

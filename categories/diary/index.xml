      <description>When I started to port the code to ESP32S3 following the example of ESP32C3, I realized I had to read the code closely. Here are the notes along the way.
Where does the code get started on esp32? Based on esp-idf, Toit (pronounced tight) creates a new platform with a new programming language for developers.
For the code to start on the esp32 device, check all the files inside toolchains/esp32/. They contains all the building details for esp32.</description>

      <title>Reading Code of Toit (002)</title>

      <description>After toit_start(), we have toit_esp32.cc to read. The first one is toit::start(). Toit here is just a namespace. As we know that toit supports OTA (over-the-air update) through WiFi and esp32 device is set to be a station (STA instead of AP).
What we have here is as follows:
 RtcMemory::set_up(); FlashRegistry::set_up(); OS::set_up(); esp_partition_find_first(); setup_program(support_ota); Scheduler::ExitState exit_state; VM vm; vm.load_platform_event_sources(); int groud_id = vm.scheduler()-&amp;gt;next_group_id(); exit_state = vm.scheduler()-&amp;gt;run_boot_program(program, null, group_id); OS::tear_down(); FlashRegistry::tear_down();  After these, esp32 may go to deep sleep.</description>

      <description>When I started to port the code to ESP32S3 following the example of ESP32C3, I realized I had to read the code closely. Here are the notes along the way.
Where does the code get started on esp32? Based on esp-idf, Toit (I like to pronounce it as tight) creates a new platform with a new programming language for developers.
For the code to start on the esp32 device, check all the files inside toolchains/esp32/.</description>

      <title>Use Jaguar to update toit code over WiFi</title>

      <description>The Jaguar tool is great.
Use an Airport to setup a WiFi network. Then download the binary of Jaguar. Run the following commands one after another. The second command requires the WiFi credentials. Use CTRL+C to stop the third one. To run the forth and the fifth command, put your computer on the same WiFi network as the esp32 device.
$./jag setup $./jag flash $./jag monitor $./jag scan $./jag run hello.</description>

      <description>Stumbled on this repo.
Run the modified code on one snowflake with 25 RGB LEDs (ws2812b-2020).

      <title>Toit on M5stack Core2</title>
      <link>https://un01s.github.io/posts/20220115/</link>

      <description>Build some examples in toit and flash it to M5Core2.
There is no problem to follow the steps in one toit discussion. While trying the step4 for ft63xx. Found a typo in package.yaml. mpu6886 should be ft63xx.
Another issue is that the touch seems not working after unplugging the USB cable. Will investigate further. Will try jaguar tool later.</description>

      <title>Rust on ESP32</title>

      <description>Start to look at the toolchain for Rust on ESP32 family modules. After some googling, here is the first result.
Clearly the toolchain is working in its early stage. $ cargo build OK. But esptool does not work. This requires further investigation. Instead the flashing tool from esp-idf is used directly to flash one esp32 dev board.
Update 2022.01.14: Both espflash and espmonitor are working.

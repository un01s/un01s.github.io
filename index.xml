      <description>Build some examples in toit and flash it to M5Core2.
There is no problem to follow the steps in one toit discussion. While trying the step4 for ft63xx. Found a typo in package.yaml. mpu6886 should be ft63xx.
Another issue is that the touch seems not working after unplugging the USB cable. Will investigate further. Will try jaguar tool later.</description>

      <title>Rust on ESP32</title>

      <description>Start to look at the toolchain for Rust on ESP32 family modules. After some googling, here is the first result.
Clearly the toolchain is working in its early stage. $ cargo build OK. But esptool does not work. This requires further investigation. Instead the flashing tool from esp-idf is used directly to flash one esp32 dev board.
Update 2022.01.14: Both espflash and espmonitor are working.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Of special importance is the case in which substantial numbers of people, acting in concert, try to assure themselves of happiness and protection against suffering through a delusional reshaping of reality. The religions of mankind too must be described as example of mass delusion. Of course, no one who still shares a delusion will ever recognize it as such.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;We never have so little protection against suffering as when we are in love; we are never so desolate when we have lost the object of our love or its love for us.</description>

      <title>Joan Didion: Why I Write</title>

      <description>Had my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer. Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. Why did the oil refineries around Carquinez Strait seem sinister to me in the summer of 1956?</description>

      <description>It all comes back. Perhaps it is difficult to see the value in having one’s self back in that kind of mood, but I do see it; I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends.</description>
